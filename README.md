# README

Fork of [benq](https://github.com/bqi343/cp-notebook) notebook, with special focus on code verification.

Codes are verified using problems in [vjudge](https://vjudge.net/). The codes for verification are provided in [verify/](https://github.com/Gotheru/cp-notebook/tree/master/Implementations/verify).

To easily compile these codes and submit them to vjudge, ```oj-bundle``` from [online-judge-tools](https://github.com/online-judge-tools/verification-helper) is really helpful.

Here is a list of verified codes as of now:
